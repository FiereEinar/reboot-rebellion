# Reboot Rebellion

Reboot Rebellion includes the development of a 2D top-down action shooter game with multi-level gameplay.

Rescue missions and a boss battle are included, which adds to the overall immersion and intensity of the game. These aspects strive to provide a unified experience by combining action, strategy, and narrative-driven objectives.
